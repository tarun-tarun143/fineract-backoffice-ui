/**
 * Guards the navigation ids a deployment's config is allowed to name.
 *
 * Those ids are a published contract. A deployment writes `"hidden": ["nav.spm"]` into a file
 * this repository never sees, and the only thing keeping that working across releases is that
 * the id does not move. So three properties have to hold, and none of them is visible in a code
 * review of a one-line nav change:
 *
 *   1. every non-divider entry has an id            — an entry without one cannot be addressed
 *   2. ids are unique                               — a duplicate makes an override ambiguous
 *   3. no id disappears without a deprecation entry — a removal silently breaks deployments
 *
 * (3) is checked against `scripts/nav-ids.json`, a committed snapshot of the ids that shipped.
 * Adding an id updates the snapshot automatically with `--update`; removing one requires saying
 * so out loud in DEPRECATED below, which is the point.
