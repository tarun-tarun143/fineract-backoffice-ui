# Renders both pieces of runtime configuration — the nginx server block and the application's
# config.json — from the environment, then hands off to nginx.
#
# ## config.json belongs to this script. Deployments must not edit it.
#
# This file is written whole on every container start, from the environment and nothing else.
# Any key it does not emit is therefore *erased* at startup, whatever the image contained.
#
# That used to be a trap. An earlier revision of this comment claimed "every key now has a
# default here, so the file is complete by construction and no key can go missing" — but the
# heredoc below emits five keys, and `allowedApiOrigins`, `institutionFeatures` and `nav` were
# added to `AppConfig` afterwards. A deployment that baked any of those into the image lost them
# silently on the next restart, `allowedApiOrigins` included, which backs a security control.
#
# The fix is not to keep this table in step with `AppConfig` forever — that is a race this script
# will keep losing. It is that a deployment has its own file now:
#
#     branding/config.json
#
# read by `ConfigService` after this one and merged over it, never written by this script or by
# upstream, and absent by default. Everything a deployment wants to set goes there. See
# DOCS/CUSTOMIZATION.md.
#
# So the rule for this heredoc is narrow: it carries only what the *container environment* is the
# right source for. Adding an `AppConfig` key here is almost always the wrong move.
