/**
 * Provides the translation library itself for specs that render shared components.
 *
 * A component written against the adapter boundary needs only {@link provideFakeAdapters},
 * which binds `I18N` to a fake. That is not enough as soon as the component under test
 * declares a shared one that still uses `| translate` directly — `app-data-table` is the
 * common case — because the pipe injects `TranslateService` from the library rather than the
 * token, and TestBed fails with NG0201 for a dependency the spec never mentions.
 *
 * Configuring the library is composition-root work, the same reason `app.config.ts` is
 * allowed to do it, so it lives here rather than being repeated in every spec. Reach for it
 * only when a spec fails on `_TranslateService`: needing it is a signal that something in the
 * rendered tree has not moved to the adapter yet, and that signal is worth keeping visible.
 *
 * See DOCS/adr/0003-adapter-boundary.md.
