 * Sets the document title from each route's `title`, treated as a translation key.

 * Angular's default strategy writes `route.title` to the document verbatim, which would
 * make the tab the only user-visible string in the app that cannot be translated. Routes
 * here therefore carry a key (`'nav.groups'`) rather than a phrase, and this strategy
 * resolves it through the I18N adapter.
 *
 * A route without a `title` inherits the nearest ancestor that has one, which is Angular's
 * own `buildTitle` behaviour: titling a section in `app.routes.ts` gives every page beneath
 * it a reasonable tab immediately, and a feature can then refine its own routes without
 * touching anything else.
 *
 * The title is re-applied when the language changes. Titles are otherwise written only on
 * navigation, so without this the tab would keep the previous language until the user
 * navigated again.
